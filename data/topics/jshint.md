[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) is a tool to detect errors before they happen. Khan Academy uses it to do that as well as to enforce some [coding style rules](https://github.com/Khan/live-editor/blob/fb69175850f3e27b4bc9303b37c4f889a7b50c74/js/shared/config.js#L372) (i.e. semicolons, braces).

You can disable it by adding a `//jshint ignore: start` comment at the top of your program. This will also give you direct access to some [global objects](https://bhavjitchauhan.github.io/Essentials/tutorial-Functionality.html#jshint:~:text=%3D%201%3B-,Global%20Objects,-JavaScript%20includes%20standard).
